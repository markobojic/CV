                    <p>
                        With a career spanning almost ten years in the IT
                        industry, I have developed a wealth of experience across
                        a variety of sectors including development, team
                        leadership, project and product management. My passion
                        lies in creating an environment where teams can perform
                        their best work, and I take great pleasure in helping
                        clients identify and implement the right solutions for
                        their products. I am dedicated to adding value to any
                        organization I work with, and I am eager to grow
                        alongside the company. My extensive experience across
                        different sectors and industries has provided me with a
                        diverse set of skills, including strong leadership and
                        the ability to communicate effectively with diverse
                        stakeholders, which will be instrumental in achieving
                        success for both the company and the clients.

                            As a student, I was an active member of the ESTIEM
                            organization, where I participated in debates, case
                            studies, and organizing student meetups.
